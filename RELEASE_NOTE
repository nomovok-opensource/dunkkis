Updating
--------

For information on how to update your existing server installation, see
README "Updating an existing server". 

In addition to the instructions in the README, you have to do some manual
changes to the database structrure. If you are installing from scratch, these
changes are automatically applied. Below are the instructions for updating
the structure.

1) Log in to the Dunkkis database. Issue the following command in the console:
   "mysql --database=<YOUR_DB_NAME> --user=<YOUR_USER_NAME> --password=<PWD>"

    The default database name is "dunkkis_demo_v3". You need to login as an
    user who has the necessary privileges to edit table structures.

2) Execute the following commands in the MySQL prompt:
   "ALTER TABLE data CHANGE COLUMN sensorid sensorid VARCHAR(48);"
   "ALTER TABLE data CHANGE COLUMN deviceid deviceid VARCHAR(48);"

3) Now execute the following command to check that the changes succeeded:
   "DESCRIBE data;"

   The result of the previous command should be as follows:
  +----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
  | Field    | Type        | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
  +----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
  | mac      | varchar(48) | NO   |     | NULL    |       | 
  | value    | float(10,4) | NO   |     | NULL    |       | 
  | type     | varchar(16) | NO   |     | NULL    |       | 
  | sensorid | varchar(48) | NO   |     | NULL    |       | 
  | deviceid | varchar(48) | NO   |     | NULL    |       | 
  | time     | datetime    | NO   | MUL | NULL    |       | 
  | logtime  | datetime    | YES  |     | NULL    |       | 
  +----------+-------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
  7 rows in set (0.10 sec)

4) You may now exit the MySQL command prompt by typing "exit;".

No further changes need be applied.
